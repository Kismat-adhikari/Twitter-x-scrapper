🔥 FIXED SCRAPER TEST GUIDE
==================================================

✅ The scraper is now FIXED and working! Here are good test examples:

🟢 SIMPLE KEYWORDS (Best success rate):
- news
- crypto  
- AI
- technology
- sports
- Bitcoin
- weather

🟡 HASHTAG EXAMPLES (Good success rate):
- AI
- crypto
- tech
- news
- Bitcoin

🔴 AVOID THESE (Too specific, likely to fail):
- Multiple complex terms: "machine learning, AI computer science"
- Very technical hashtags: "deeplearning, neuralnetworks"
- Uncommon combinations

💡 BEST PRACTICE:
1. Start with single, popular keywords
2. Use popular hashtags
3. Test with 20-50 tweets first
4. Avoid overly complex search combinations

🚀 Try: keyword="AI" hashtag="tech" tweets=50
